TicTacToe
=========

Simple Tic Tac Toe written in Java. Has singleplayer mode with both an easy and hard mode AI.

Easy mode AI just selects a random available space, and puts his marker there.
Hard mode AI attempts to predict how the player is trying to win, and blocks it, not 100% successful.

Some very cruddy code, feel free to make it more efficient/readable, or give ideas on how to do so to me, I'm still learning!
